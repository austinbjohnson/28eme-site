# Handoff Reference

This repo follows the shared workflow documented at the websites root.

- Master session notes: `../handoff/SESSION_NOTES.md`
- Co-dev reminders: `../REMINDER.md`

## Site-Specific Notes

- [x] After next content pass, log the verified `28eme.ca` / `.com` DNS status in `docs/log-oct-2025`.
- [x] Flesh out the service/process narrative and iterate on the production layout.
- [x] Adapt the "About Austin" story into a consulting-focused portfolio with sections for experience snapshots, offer, and proof points.
- [ ] Re-check `https://www.28eme.com` once Squarespace forwarding finishes and update the DNS log with the result.
