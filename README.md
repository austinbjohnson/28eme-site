# 28eme Studio — Consulting Site

This repository will power the service-facing side of 28eme at https://28eme.ca. It complements the personal site at https://austinbjohnson.com by focusing on automation consulting, composite AI experiments, and case studies.

## Initial To-Do
- [x] Finalize site information architecture (Home, Services, Process, Experiments, Contact).
- [x] Draft hero copy and CTA aligned with the consulting offer.
- [ ] Add visual identity elements that relate to the personal site while feeling distinct.
- [ ] Connect GitHub Pages (`main` branch) and point the `28eme.ca` domain.
- [ ] Link back to the personal site in navigation and footer.

## Getting Started
1. `git init` (after the GitHub repo is created, `git remote add origin git@github.com:austinbjohnson/28eme-site.git`).
2. Commit the base structure and push to `main`.
3. Enable GitHub Pages: Settings → Pages → “Deploy from a branch” (`main` + `/`).
4. Set the custom domain to `28eme.ca` and commit the generated `CNAME` file.

## Directory Preview
- `docs/` — planning, copy drafts, technical references.
- `public/` — static assets (fonts, images) when you add them.
- `src/` — HTML/CSS/JS or templates if you adopt a generator.

Refer back to `docs/roadmap/plan.md` in the personal repo for shared milestones.
