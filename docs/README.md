# 28eme Consulting Docs

Central planning hub for the consulting site at https://28eme.ca.

## Structure
- `content/` — messaging, service descriptions, case-study outlines.
- `process/` — delivery frameworks, client onboarding notes, templates.
- `roadmap/` — milestone tracking and backlog.
- `technical/` — deployment setup, automation experiments, integration notes.

Each document should start with status, owner, last updated, and next review date. Log major decisions in `../docs/changelog.md` in the personal repo or mirror the entry here once this repo is live.
