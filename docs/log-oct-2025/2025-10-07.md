# 2025-10-07 — Content Pass + DNS Check

**Focus:** convert placeholder landing into consulting-ready messaging and confirm live domain status.

## Domain Observations
- `https://28eme.ca` returns `200` over HTTPS from GitHub Pages (`curl -I` at 2025-10-07 04:21 UTC).
- `https://28eme.com` now lands on the HTTPS site per user confirmation (local `curl` still observes a 301 to `http://28eme.ca`, likely CDN cache); treated as resolved.
- `https://www.28eme.com` confirmed working by the user after forwarding propagation; continue to spot-check in future passes until local DNS agrees.

## Content Updates
- Replaced the “What’s coming” placeholder with services, process, experience, and proof sections.
- Tuned hero copy and CTAs to align with the automation-first consulting offer.
- Captured session context in `handoff.md` and ensured next actions stay visible.
